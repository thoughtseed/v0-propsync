# Architecture Decisions Record (ADR)

## Overview
This document captures the key architectural decisions made in the Propsync property management application, providing context and rationale for future development.

## ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need to build a modern, scalable property management application with real-time capabilities, user authentication, and complex data relationships.

### Decision
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI + shadcn/ui
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid development with integrated auth and database
- Type safety across the entire stack
- Modern React patterns with server components
- Excellent developer experience

**Negative:**
- Vendor lock-in with Supabase
- Limited customization of auth flows
- Potential scaling costs with Supabase

## ADR-002: Database Architecture - Normalized vs JSONB Hybrid

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Property data is complex and varied, with some fields being structured (basic info) and others being flexible (amenities, features).

### Decision
Implement a hybrid approach:
- **Structured tables** for core property data (properties, property_safety, property_kitchen, etc.)
- **JSONB columns** for flexible, list-based data (amenities, features, configurations)
- **Separate tables** for each major property category

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Maintains referential integrity for core data
- Flexibility for varying property types
- Efficient queries for structured data
- Easy to extend with new property types

**Negative:**
- Complex joins for complete property views
- JSONB queries can be less performant
- Requires careful indexing strategy

## ADR-003: Multi-Step Wizard Pattern

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Property onboarding involves 100+ fields across multiple categories. Single-page forms would be overwhelming and have poor UX.

### Decision
Implement a progressive disclosure wizard with:
- **8 main categories** with 20+ individual steps
- **Context-based state management** for form data
- **Auto-save functionality** with debounced updates
- **Progress tracking** with completion percentages
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Excellent user experience with manageable chunks
- Clear progress indication
- Reduced cognitive load
- Mobile-friendly interface

**Negative:**
- Complex state management
- Increased development complexity
- Potential for incomplete data

## ADR-004: Authentication and Authorization Strategy

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need secure, scalable authentication with role-based access control for different user types.

### Decision
- **Supabase Auth** for authentication
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for data isolation
- **Middleware-based route protection**
- **Role-based access control** (admin, manager, staff, readonly)

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Built-in security best practices
- Automatic session management
- Database-level security
- Easy to implement and maintain

**Negative:**
- Limited customization of auth flows
- Dependency on Supabase for critical functionality
- Complex RLS policies for advanced scenarios

---

## ADR-005: State Management Approach

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need to manage complex form state across multiple steps while keeping the application lightweight.

### Decision
- **React Context API** for wizard state management
- **Server state** managed by Next.js server actions
- **Local state** for UI interactions
- **No external state management library** (Redux, Zustand)

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Minimal dependencies
- Leverages React's built-in capabilities
- Server-first approach with Next.js
- Easier to understand and maintain

**Negative:**
- Context re-renders can impact performance
- Limited debugging tools compared to Redux
- May need refactoring for complex global state

---

## ADR-006: Component Architecture and Design System

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need consistent, accessible, and maintainable UI components across the application.

### Decision
- **Radix UI primitives** for accessibility and behavior
- **shadcn/ui** for pre-built component patterns
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Component composition** over inheritance
- **Responsive-first design**

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Excellent accessibility out of the box
- Consistent design language
- Highly customizable components
- Strong TypeScript support

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for Radix patterns
- Larger bundle size with many primitives
- Potential for inconsistent customizations

---

## ADR-007: File Upload and Media Management

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Properties require multiple images, floor plans, and documents with secure storage and efficient delivery.

### Decision
- **Supabase Storage** for file hosting
- **Client-side upload** with progress tracking
- **Image optimization** disabled for compatibility
- **Structured file organization** by property and type

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Integrated with existing Supabase infrastructure
- Built-in security and access controls
- Simple implementation

**Negative:**
- Limited image optimization options
- Potential bandwidth costs
- Dependency on Supabase for media delivery

---

## ADR-008: Data Validation Strategy

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need robust validation for complex property data while maintaining good user experience.

### Decision
- **Zod schemas** for type-safe validation
- **Client-side validation** for immediate feedback
- **Server-side validation** for security
- **Progressive validation** in wizard steps
- **Custom validation hooks** for reusable logic

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Type safety between client and server
- Excellent developer experience
- Consistent validation logic
- Good user feedback

**Negative:**
- Duplicate validation logic
- Bundle size increase
- Complex validation for nested objects

---

## ADR-009: Performance and Optimization

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need to balance rich functionality with performance, especially on mobile devices.

### Decision
- **Server Components** for static content
- **Client Components** only when necessary
- **Debounced auto-save** to reduce API calls
- **Lazy loading** for non-critical components
- **Image optimization disabled** for deployment compatibility

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Faster initial page loads
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Better mobile performance
- Efficient data fetching

**Negative:**
- Complex component boundaries
- Potential hydration issues
- Limited image optimization

## ADR-010: Development and Deployment Workflow

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need efficient development workflow with reliable deployments and easy collaboration.

### Decision
- **v0.dev integration** for rapid prototyping
- **Vercel deployment** with automatic builds
- **TypeScript strict mode** with build error ignoring for deployment
- **ESLint configuration** with deployment overrides

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid development and iteration
- Automatic deployments
- Good developer experience

**Negative:**
- Potential for runtime errors with ignored build errors
- Dependency on external services
- Limited control over build process

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements
1. **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis or similar for frequently accessed data
2. **Search Functionality**: Add full-text search with PostgreSQL or external service
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions
4. **Mobile App**: Consider React Native or PWA for mobile experience
5. **Analytics**: Add property performance tracking and reporting
6. **Multi-tenancy**: Enhance for property management companies

### Technical Debt
1. **Image Optimization**: Re-enable when deployment issues are resolved
2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries
3. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Expand API and component documentation
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add real user monitoring and performance tracking

## Decision Process

For future architectural decisions:
1. **Document the context** and constraints
2. **Consider alternatives** with pros/cons
3. **Make the decision** with clear rationale
4. **Update this document** with the new ADR
5. **Communicate changes** to the team

This living document should be updated as the architecture evolves and new decisions are made.
