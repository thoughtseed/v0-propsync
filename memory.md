# PROJECT MEMORY

## Overview
**Propsync** is a comprehensive property management application built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Supabase. It's designed for managing rental properties with detailed property information, safety features, amenities, and guest experiences. The application was originally built using v0.dev and is deployed on Vercel.

## Completed Tasks

### [2025-01-27] Fix Next.js 15 Async API Errors
- **Outcome**: Successfully resolved Next.js 15 async API errors for params and cookies() across the entire application
- **Breakthrough**: Identified that Next.js 15 requires awaiting dynamic APIs like params and cookies() before accessing their properties
- **Errors Fixed**: "Route used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited" and "cookies().get() should be awaited" errors throughout the application
- **Code Changes**: Updated 10+ files including app/properties/[id]/page.tsx, lib/supabase/server.ts, and all server actions to properly await dynamic APIs. Made createClient, getServerSupabaseClient, and getAdminSupabaseClient async functions.
- **Next Dependencies**: Ensures compatibility with Next.js 15 and prevents runtime warnings in production

### [2025-01-27] Authentication Error Fix (PGRST116)
- **Outcome**: Fixed authentication errors preventing users from accessing the application after login
- **Breakthrough**: Identified that authenticated users were bypassing the AuthSetupCheck component which only appeared on the login page
- **Errors Fixed**: PGRST116 errors ("The result contains 0 rows") when fetching user profiles and roles, and net::ERR_ABORTED errors on /properties page
- **Code Changes**: Added AuthSetupCheck component to protected layout (`app/(protected)/layout.tsx`) so all authenticated users see database setup prompt if users table doesn't exist
- **Next Dependencies**: Ensures proper database setup flow for all users, preventing authentication-related crashes

### [2025-01-27] Client-Side Authentication Error Handling
- **Outcome**: Fixed client-side authentication errors that were causing console errors and unhandled exceptions
